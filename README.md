# seal-skills

Security knowledge graph for AI agents. 27 domains, 111 certification controls, from the [SEAL Frameworks](https://github.com/security-alliance/frameworks).

```bash
# Ask any security question — the agent finds the right domain automatically
> My multisig was compromised, what do I do?
> How do I set up incident response for our protocol?
> We're hiring remote devs — any DPRK concerns?
```

---

## What this does

Gives your AI agent (Hermes, Claude, Cursor, etc.) structured Web3/blockchain security knowledge across 27 domains — from incident response and multisig operations to DPRK worker detection and supply chain security.

**Pure security focus.** Not a general-purpose skill collection. Exclusively SEAL security domains from Security Alliance frameworks.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clanktank/seal-skills.git ~/.hermes/skills/seal
```

For private inference (sensitive security data):

```bash
hermes config set provider.base_url "https://api.venice.ai/v1"
hermes config set provider.model "qwen3-5-35b-a3b"
hermes restart
```

Verify it works:

```bash
hermes chat --toolsets skills -q "What seal skills do you have?"
```

## Usage

**Discord:** `@mention` the bot and ask any security question naturally.

**Telegram / CLI:** Say things like:
- "check my security posture"
- "help me set up multisig"
- "we just got hacked, what do I do"
- "daily security tips" (sets up coach with daily lessons)

The agent matches your question to the right domain and answers using the SEAL frameworks.

## Skill Types

SEAL skills come in two complementary formats:

### Root Skills (Comprehensive)
- **Location:** `/<domain>/` (e.g., `/wallet-security/`)
- **Purpose:** Deep framework knowledge, certification study, incident analysis
- **Best for:** Security teams building programs, understanding the "why" behind practices
- **Characteristics:** 10-50+ reference files, extensive cross-domain links, gotchas from real incidents

### Advisor Skills (Concise)
- **Location:** `/advisors/<domain>-advisor/` (e.g., `/advisors/wallet-security-advisor/`)
- **Purpose:** Quick guidance, actionable checklists, chatroom support
- **Best for:** Rapid triage decisions, community support bots, "what to do now" answers
- **Characteristics:** 2-4 focused reference files, checklists, red flag lists

**Example workflow:** Use advisor for quick triage ("Is this wallet setup secure?"), then dive into root skill for deep understanding ("Why do we need hardware wallets?"), then return to advisor for next steps.

## Domains (27)

| Domain | Focus |
|--------|-------|
| **incident-management** | Response playbooks, containment, recovery |
| **multisig-for-protocols** | Signer management, thresholds, backup signing |
| **treasury-operations** | Fund classification, diversification, controls |
| **wallet-security** | Seed phrases, hardware wallets, signing verification |
| **supply-chain** | Dependency auditing, lockfiles, vendoring |
| **infrastructure** | OS hardening, network security, cloud configuration |
| **iam** | Access control, least privilege, RBAC |
| **monitoring** | SIEM, alerting, anomaly detection |
| **threat-modeling** | Asset identification, attack surface analysis |
| **dprk-it-workers** | Worker infiltration detection, identity verification |
| **safe-harbor** | Whitehat protections, scope terms |
| **vulnerability-disclosure** | Bug bounties, responsible disclosure |
| **opsec** | Operational security, information classification |
| **privacy** | Encrypted comms, VPN, metadata protection |
| **encryption** | At-rest, in-transit, key management |
| **devsecops** | CI/CD security, code signing, branch protection |
| **governance** | Compliance, risk assessment, security KPIs |
| **external-security-reviews** | Audit lifecycle, vendor selection |
| **front-end-web-app** | CSP, supply chain, XSS prevention |
| **community-management** | Discord/Telegram security, bot moderation |
| **secure-software-development** | Code review, secure coding practices |
| **security-testing** | Penetration testing, fuzzing, red teaming |
| **security-automation** | As-code, automated scanning, SOAR |
| **ens** | ENS domain security, record verification |
| **certs** | SEAL certification frameworks (6 SFCs, 111 controls) |
| **awareness** | Phishing, social engineering, training |
| **user-team-security** | Security culture, onboarding, phishing defense |

## Coach Mode

The seal-coach skill provides Duolingo-style security training:

- **Daily tips** — one security lesson per day, relevant to your domain
- **Readiness assessment** — 8-10 questions to measure your security posture
- **Hardening plans** — prioritized action items based on assessment
- **Progress tracking** — streaks, domain scores, completed lessons
- **Urgency path** — immediate triage for active threats

Start coaching by saying "daily security tips" or "check my readiness."

## How it works

Each domain is a skill with cross-domain triggers and gotchas:

```
~/.hermes/skills/seal/
├── INDEX.md                         # Trigger table — routes questions to domains
├── SEAL-COACH/                      # Coach skill (daily tips, assessments)

├── wallet-security/                 # Seed phrases, HW wallets
└── ... (24 more domains)
```

## Security & Privacy

SEAL skills handle information about an organization's security posture — which controls they fail, weak configurations, incident gaps. **Using these with a cloud LLM sends sensitive security data to a third party.**

### Provider trust

| Provider | What they see | Risk | When to use |
|----------|--------------|------|-------------|
| **Local LLM** (Ollama, vLLM) | Nothing leaves the machine | None | Highest security |
| **Venice.ai** | Queries during inference, no retention | Low | Privacy + quality balance |
| **Self-hosted** (Modal, Lambda) | You control infra | Low-Medium | Scale + full control |
| **Anthropic/Claude** | All queries retained | High | Non-sensitive only |
| **OpenRouter** | Aggregator, varies by provider | Varies | Never for sensitive data |

Venice.ai guarantees no data retention and no training on user data. "No retention" is a policy, not a technical guarantee — treat Venice as lower-risk than Anthropic/OpenAI, but not equivalent to local inference.

### What flows to the LLM

- Your security questions (reveals what you're worried about)
- Answers to cert controls ("no" = specific gap identified)
- Incident scenarios (details of breaches)
- Gotchas discussed (known weaknesses)

**Rule:** Before deploying for any organization, ask: *"Are we comfortable with our inference provider seeing this data?"* If no, use local inference or Venice.ai.
