# SEAL Security Knowledge Graph

27 domains from [Security Alliance Frameworks](https://github.com/security-alliance/frameworks).

## Trigger Table

**Note:** This table routes to comprehensive root skills (`seal-*` prefix). For quick chatroom guidance, use advisor skills in `/advisors/` directory (e.g., `wallet-security-advisor`).

## How It Works

1. Match user question to a row above
2. `skill_view("seal-<domain>")` to load it
3. Follow `related_skills` in that domain's frontmatter for cross-references
4. `skill_view("seal-<domain>", "references/file.md")` for deeper content
