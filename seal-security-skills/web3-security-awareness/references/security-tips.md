# Shareable Security Tips

Quick security tips suitable for sharing in chatrooms, Discord, or social media.

## Wallet Security

**Never share your seed phrase. Ever.**
No legitimate service, support, or person will ever need it. Anyone asking is a scammer. Write it on paper, store it safely, never type it anywhere except your hardware wallet.

---

**Use a hardware wallet for significant funds.**
If you have more than you'd be comfortable losing, get a Ledger or Trezor. The $79-$200 investment protects against most remote attacks.

---

**Check token approvals regularly.**
Visit revoke.cash monthly. Revoke approvals for sites you no longer use. Old unlimited approvals are ticking time bombs.

---

**Use separate wallets for different purposes.**
Hot wallet for daily use. Hardware wallet for savings. Burner wallet for minting sketchy NFTs. Don't put all eggs in one basket.

---

## Recognizing Scams

**If someone DMs you first, they're probably a scammer.**
Real support doesn't DM you. Real opportunities don't find you. If it feels unsolicited, it's probably a scam.

---

**Free money isn't free.**
Every "airdrop" that requires connecting your wallet could drain it. Every "giveaway" that requires sending crypto first is a scam. If it sounds too good to be true, it is.

---

**Urgency is a red flag.**
"Act now!" "Limited time!" "Your funds are at risk!" Scammers create urgency because thinking is their enemy. Real opportunities allow time for verification.

---

**Verify, don't trust.**
Before sending funds, verify the address through a different channel. Before clicking links, verify the URL character by character. Before trusting someone, verify their identity independently.

---

## Operational Security

**Bookmark your crypto sites.**
Never click links to exchanges or dApps. Type URLs manually or use bookmarks. One mistyped character can lead to a clone site.

---

**Different passwords everywhere.**
Use a password manager. Generate unique passwords for every crypto site. One breach shouldn't compromise everything.

---

**MFA everything.**
Enable 2FA on all crypto-related accounts. Hardware keys > authenticator apps > SMS. Never give anyone your 2FA codes.

---

**Assume you'll be targeted.**
The question isn't if but when. Being paranoid isn't paranoid if they're actually after you. The bigger your bags, the bigger the target.

---

## Recovery & Safety

**If something feels wrong, stop.**
That weird transaction request? Don't sign it. That suspicious link? Don't click it. Your gut feeling is often right.

---

**What to do if compromised:**
1. Transfer remaining funds to new wallet (new seed!)
2. Revoke all approvals from compromised wallet
3. Check what was accessed/approved
4. That address is burned forever - never use again

---

**The seed phrase fire drill:**
Do you know exactly where your seed phrase is? Could you access it right now if needed? If not, fix that today.

---

## Community Tips

**Report scams to protect others.**
See a scam? Report it. Flag the Discord message, report the Twitter account, warn your community. We protect each other.

---

**It's okay to ask.**
Not sure if something is legit? Ask in a trusted community first. Better to feel silly asking than to lose your funds.

---

**Security is a team sport.**
Share these tips with friends new to crypto. One informed person can prevent many scams. We're all in this together.
